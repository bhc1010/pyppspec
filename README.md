# All-Electronic Pump-Probe Spectroscopy
A python solution for preforming all-electronic pump-probe spectroscopy via scanning tunneling microscope.
Logic for preforming experiments is contained in src/pumpProbe.py, devices.py, and rhk.py. UI code is contained in the files src/app.py, src/qcustomwidgets.py, and src/run.py.
Most of the code in src/rhk.py has been repurposed/reproduced from .
